# Four phases of video

An analogue TV signal such as composite video can be split into four phases for horizontal video.

- First, there is a synchronisation pulse to mark the beginning of a new line (horizontal sync).
- Then there is a period between the sync pulse and the actual video, known as the "back porch"; no video is drawn within the back porch. However, there is a brief burst of signal to synchronise the GPU and monitor's colour oscillators, called the "colour burst".
- Then the actual video is displayed by modulating the brightness and colour together, known variously as the "display phase" or "active video".
- Finally, there is a brief pause to mark the end of the line before the next one appears, called the "front porch".

Some explanations put the front porch at the front of the line, but specifications state the front porch is at the end of a line and I'll follow them.

For vertical video, the phases are similar but different.

- First, there is a series of long synchronisation pulses to mark the beginning of a new frame (vertical sync).
- Then, there is a series of short synchronisation pulses, in the "back porch".
- Then, the actual video is displayed along the horizontal lines.
- Finally, there is a series of short synchronisation pulses, in the "front porch".
